<p>Through careful varietal choices, selective breeding, cloning, hybridization, thoughtful site selection and perhaps pure stubbornness, humans have managed to grow <em>vitis vinifera</em> and its relatives in an ever widening range of locations and climates to produce wines of increasing distinction. An evaluation of wines in familiar places in comparison to wines made at the margins can give us a glimpse into the range of terroir expression in winemaking and viticulture. Additionally, that same exploration of the extremes can help us understand where we might need to go in order to adapt to a challenging global climate.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wine grapevine <em>vitis vinifera</em> is a mediterranean plant and thrives in a temperate climate. The vine requires the following factors to successfully ripen fruit suitable for producing a tasty dry table wine. Table 1 summarizes these requirements but when making evaluations of a site for new plantings or existing plantings we need to “think like a vine” and consider these general ideas (Postmodern Winemaking).&nbsp; The grapevine needs energy to grow. It needs enough heat in the early season to grow it’s leaves, the power source, and it needs that energy to continue through the summer to ripen it’s berries by converting acids into sugars. Not too much though, too much heat or direct sunlight can damage the berries or ripen them in an unbalanced way. There is more to making good wine than just lots of sugar.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vine needs water. The right amount of water, as rain, irrigation or both, at the right time enables healthy growth and encourages reproduction, the formation of delicious fruit. Let’s illustrate this with extremes. Too much water in the spring and the plant lives too contentedly, growing too much vegetation and not diverting energy to the berries. Too much water during the fall harvest can dilute flavors or encourage the formation of fungal growth on the fruit. Water must be carefully balanced throughout the year and careful site selection makes this a natural process or one requiring significant intervention by the grower. A note on water, could not forget to include the soil type that the vine is grown in. The ability of the land to retain or shed water is vital to the growth of the plant, considering the vine’s root system can extend 3 to 4 meters under the surface, the bulk of the plant is exposed to the soil, not the world above. The discussion of soil then, leads us naturally into the world of artistic expression in viticulture and winemaking and our favorite (only?) french word, <em>terroir</em>.</p>

<p>Once the general requirements have been considered, we move to the art. The love, passion and expression that draws so many to wine as more than just a tasty beverage. We write about it, travel for it, sing to it and critique it heavily all in search of <em>terroir</em>, the sense of place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept of terroir has a history rooted in a formal system of governance of wine styles in the “old world” and through the growth of the “new world” wine regions has the meaning of terroir changed and been opened up to debate. The system that once protected regional styles for the consumer and producer has had to adapt to a whole new world of pioneers seeking to develop their own styles while honoring the roots of the craft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The importance of terroir, the means of it’s expression or suppression and its importance in sales of regional wines varies across the world. There are five factors we can consider when assessing the terroir of a wine. These are climate, soil, terrain, tradition and microbiome. Let’s consider climate. This isn’t the most important factor, it certainly isn’t the only factor, especially for the example we’ll see, but it can be the easiest to discuss and compare to demonstrate the impact that these regional differences can have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at the range of latitudes the vine is grown, we can see that a region closer to 50°&nbsp; will have a cooler climate generally, wines further south will be warmer. Wines grown at higher latitudes in a cooler climate have extended growing seasons and can even struggle to ripen fully by the time the fall season becomes too harsh. Cool weather wines are known to be more acidic with tart fruit flavors. Wines grown south, closer to 30° latitude, will generally have a warmer wine characteristic. Higher sugar content at harvest, less acid, more ripe fruit flavors. Sneaking in another factor really quick, there are a whole range of traditions that come from the logistics of growing in different regions and the challenges the vines face. The obvious comparisons to make in American wines are Pinot Noir from Oregon or Sonoma, or Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa or Washington state, all beautiful examples of local terroir reflecting the direct impact of cool weather or warm weather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we said, climate is not the only factor and it’s very easy to see complicated expressions of a given varietal. In the USA, grape growing regions land mostly near large bodies of water. The Pacific and Atlantic coasts and the great lakes in the midwest. The effects of the oceans in addition to regional terrain can create a range of mesoclimates from a region that may have an assumed character. California being another example of this. Inland from the coast in the low central valley is an obviously hot weather location, while toward the coast, or near the Ssan Francisco Bay, or higher in the Santa Cruz mountains; regular movement of cool ocean air and fog can create a predictable climate of a cooler nature.</p>

<p>Even looking at climate alone as a determiner of terroir can get complicated, fast. Begin adding in the other 4 factors, and the history of the concept of terroir in the french system of governance of wine production and it’s not a stretch at all to imagine why there is a continuous debate about it’s meaning. The New World is impacting this discussion in exciting ways and regions embracing their local terroir, instead of seeking to produce a varietal’s “traditional” character will continue to produce wines of distinction and excitement for their communities to gather around.</p>
