<p>For my third post this is going to be a bit out there but I've got an idea and I'm having trouble finding people who have tried it. One of those times I reject the idea that I've thought of something original.</p>

<p>So, a quick review on the current understanding of smoke taint in wine shows the following mechanism:</p>

<p>The compounds Guaiacol, m-cresol and 4-methylguaiacol have the lowest detection limits from 20 - 30 ug/L. These are the indicator compounds for standard testing (through ETS or a similar lab). These compounds are taken up by the grape berry, sequestered into the skin. They are bound up enzymatically by glycosytransferase, binding them to a sugar molecule. This is why they aren't detectable in juice. These compounds have a similar shape to the compound trans-reversatrol, which shows up during fungal infection, plant stress, etc. Maybe it's anti microbial, anti-oxidative...I dunno, I could read more about it, but doesn't matter right now. It's a natural part of the plant and basically a coincidence. There might be some other fun stuff to be done there, but that's for later.</p>

<p>So, these smoke compounds, phenols, are bound up with sugar. During fermentation however, they are freed from their sugary bounds by our microbial friends. Utilizing enzymes like beta-glucosidase to perform the hydrolysis. These guaiacol compounds shows up again in finished wine! Darn... Work done by Dr Kerry Wilkinson from University of Adelaide shows the increasing concentration of these compounds over the course of maceration and primary and ML fermentation. The bad news here from her data is guaiacol present at 1 ug/L in free run juice had a concentration over 60 ug/L after a single day of maceration. We're already about the detection limits of these nasty compounds. Darn again...</p>

<p>With Oregon having a bad time with smoke, there is lots of conversation about doing micro-ferments to check for smoke damage or sending grape samples out for analysis. Well...ETS is backed up ~4 months and micro ferments might take 2 weeks to find out. We're close to picking.</p>

<p>Everyone I've read (only access to free stuff online) has always run their juice samples through GC/MS or some other lab analytical technique. That's great and all but what about the small winemaker. So I want to try just pushing the enzymatic hydrolysis. I bet Scottzyme KS (An aspergillus niger enyzme derivative) has what we need.  Macerate some juice, add some Beta-glucosidase, maybe adjust pH (some reading says optimal pH 4.2), bring the temp up to 40 C, and stir gently for....12 hours? Would you be able to smell/taste smoke taint if it's present? You could play with the maceration a bit. Add alcohol, add stems. Whatever, but just break every single sugar free like a mad person and see if you can smell that ash tray.</p>

<p>Just a thought. Kind of worry about putting that mixture in my mouth but maybe just smell?</p>
